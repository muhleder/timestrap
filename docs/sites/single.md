## Single Site

Out of the box, Timestrap is a single site using the fake domain `time.strap`
and name `Timestrap`. If there is no need for multiple sites, simply 
manipulate the configuration for this initial site.

Any domain will fall back to the default site, but it is recommended that at 
least the site domain setting be updated to match the actual site domain. 
Visit  `/admin/sites/site/1/change/` to make changes to the configuration.
