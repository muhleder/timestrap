## Sites

Timestrap takes advantage of [Django's "sites" framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/sites/)
to support running multiple Timestrap "sites" from a single instance of the
application. This an optional enhancement, and the base Timestrap application 
will work fine as a single site without any advanced configuration.
